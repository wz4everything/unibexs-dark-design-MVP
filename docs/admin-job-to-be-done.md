## Overview
The admin application management system helps administrative users efficiently process and manage student visa applications through a structured workflow. The system consists of two main pages: the Applications List page and the Application Details page.

## Admin Applications List Page - Job To Be Done

### Primary Job
**"When I log in as an admin, I want to quickly see all pending applications that need my attention, so I can prioritize my work and ensure no applications are delayed."**

### Secondary Jobs
1. **"When I scan the applications list, I want to immediately identify which applications are urgent or overdue, so I can address them first."**
2. **"When I see application summaries, I want enough information to decide whether I need to review the full details, so I can work efficiently."**
3. **"When I need to process multiple similar applications, I want to perform bulk actions, so I can save time on routine operations."**
4. **"When I'm looking for a specific application, I want to search and filter quickly, so I can find what I need without scrolling through hundreds of entries."**

### Success Criteria
