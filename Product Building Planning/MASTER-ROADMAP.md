## Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
1. **LocalStorage Migration**: Complex data transformation
   - Mitigation: Sprint 6-7 dedicated to careful migration
2. **Testing Complexity**: Large codebase without tests
   - Mitigation: Incremental testing approach in Sprints 4-5
3. **Authentication Overhaul**: Breaking existing workflows
   - Mitigation: Backward compatibility in Sprint 8

### **Resource Risks**
1. **Two-Developer Team**: Limited parallel work
   - Mitigation: Clear frontend/backend separation
2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Complex workflow engine
   - Mitigation: Documentation updates each sprint
