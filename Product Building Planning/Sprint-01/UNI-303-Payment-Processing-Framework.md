# UNI-303: Add Payment Processing Framework

## Jira Ticket Details
**Type**: Story  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Assignee**: Backend Developer  
**Epic**: Stage 3 Visa Processing  

## Summary
Implement payment processing framework for visa application fees, university deposits, and processing charges with support for multiple payment gateways and currencies.

## Description
Stage 3 visa processing requires payment handling for various fees (visa application fees, processing charges, university deposits). Need a flexible payment framework that supports multiple gateways, currencies, and payment types while maintaining transaction security and audit trails.

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Payment Framework Core
- [ ] Payment entity model with transaction tracking
- [ ] Support for multiple payment types:
  - Visa application fees
  - Processing charges  
  - University deposit payments
  - Express processing fees
- [ ] Multi-currency support (USD, EUR, GBP, local currencies)
- [ ] Payment status lifecycle management

### ✅ Gateway Integration Framework
- [ ] Abstract payment gateway interface
- [ ] Mock payment gateway for development/testing
- [ ] Stripe integration preparation (configuration only)
- [ ] PayPal integration preparation (configuration only)
- [ ] Gateway failure handling and retry logic

### ✅ Transaction Management
- [ ] Payment initiation and tracking
- [ ] Transaction ID generation and storage
- [ ] Payment confirmation and verification
- [ ] Refund and cancellation support
- [ ] Payment history and audit logging

### ✅ Business Logic Integration
- [ ] Automatic status progression after successful payment
- [ ] Payment deadline management and reminders
- [ ] Partial payment support where applicable
- [ ] Integration with application workflow engine
- [ ] Commission calculation framework (for Stage 5 preparation)

## Technical Requirements

### New Files
```
src/lib/payments/
├── payment-engine.ts          # Core payment processing
├── payment-gateways.ts        # Gateway abstractions
├── transaction-manager.ts     # Transaction lifecycle
├── currency-converter.ts      # Multi-currency support
└── mock-gateway.ts           # Development gateway
```

### Data Models
```typescript
interface Payment {
  id: string
  applicationId: string
  type: PaymentType
  amount: number
  currency: string
  status: PaymentStatus
  gateway: PaymentGateway
  transactionId?: string
  createdAt: Date
  paidAt?: Date
  failureReason?: string
}

enum PaymentType {
  VISA_FEE = 'visa_fee',
  PROCESSING_FEE = 'processing_fee',
  UNIVERSITY_DEPOSIT = 'university_deposit',
  EXPRESS_FEE = 'express_fee'
}
```

### Integration Points
- Application status transitions
- Document management (payment receipts)
- Email notifications for payment events
- Admin dashboard payment monitoring

## Dependencies
- UNI-301 (Stage 3 workflow configuration)
- Payment gateway API credentials (for future sprints)
- Currency conversion service selection

## Security Requirements
- [ ] No sensitive payment data stored locally
- [ ] PCI compliance considerations documented
- [ ] Secure token-based gateway communication
- [ ] Payment data encryption at rest
- [ ] Audit logging for all payment events

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for payment logic
- Integration tests with mock gateway
- Security testing for data handling
- Manual testing of payment flows
